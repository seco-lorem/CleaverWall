        The Project aims to create an anti-malware mechanism to detect whether a portable executable file is malicious, if so, to classify the malware type. For that purpose, a set of malware classifiers trained with various machine learning techniques are going to be used. Static and dynamic analysis are going to be done to extract features from the executable’s structure and activities. Malware classifiers are going to be utilised according to the analysis type.  Different malware classifiers will be run on client's and remote machines for different context-dependent purposes. Those purposes include: scanning a specific file, auto-scanning (on user's will), directory scanning.The application will provide users with a set of options such as quarantine and elimination of an executable if it detects a malware in it. Log files containing information regarding the scanning and other processes will be generated. Consequently, the main purpose of this project is to be lightweight and provide these features with high classification performance by not downgrading the accuracy rates of the models.
